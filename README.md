### Future Features


* A schedule page that would list the Ducks' opponenets for the 2024/25 NHL season. Ths could be seperated by month with clear indicators for whether it is a home or away game.

  
* I would like to include a history page. This would detail the team's entire history from 1993. It would also include some of the team's greatest players and statistical breakdowns of past seasons.


* A more detailed roster page with internal links for each member of the roster. This would include statistics and a brief biography along with transaction history and contract information.


* A gallery of games and team events. This could inlude images form games along with fan events and the team's charitable endeavours. Video could be added for game hightlights and post-game interviews. 


* The inclusion of a contact page would allow more interaction with the user. Should the user wish to make contact, a variety of contact options would be available to them to make contact.

* A page with more information of the team's home arena. This would include ticket information, a map of the arena, a guide to local hotels and atractions, and local transport links. There could also be an option for n external link to the Honda Center website.
